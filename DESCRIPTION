Description: This package takes formatted time records, and performs
    some basic analysis on them. It specifically allows people to make
    observations about their commute time from home to the parking lot
    to the office, or place of final arrival. It plots, performs ANOVA
    if different days have been recorded, and displays results in a
    nice to read format with a recommendation for what time to head
    out each day.
