Commute Analysis via Googlesheets in R

A class project to analyze daily commute times for 
statistical significance of several factors, including, but
not all realized, time one left for the office, what one was
listening to in the car, what day it was, and whether or not
there were any extenuating circumstances, such as a car
accident.

This is my first foray into writing an R package, and though 
it is GPL-3 licensed, it is mainly just for fun and skills
development.
